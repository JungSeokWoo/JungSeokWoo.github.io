  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Lane detection is an essential component for autonomous driving. Our algorithm achieves global top-level accuracy and real-time performance on mobile platform.
    Our paper has been accepted in ECCV 2020 Workshop on Perception for Autonomous Driving(https://sites.google.com/view/pad2020).

    We proposed fast and robust lane detection method based on an instance segmentation approach. Our algorithm achieved global rank 3 on the Tusimple Lane Detection Benchmark([link](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/lane-detection-on-tusimple)) and real-time performance on mobile platform.
    Our paper has been accepted in [ECCV 2020 Workshop on Perception for Autonomous Driving](https://sites.google.com/view/pad2020).
    We implemented GPU/DSP/NPU runtime based DNN application by using <mark>Android</mark>, <mark>C++JNI</mark>, <mark>OpenCL</mark> and Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK(<mark>SNPE</mark>).

    We developed an autonomous vehicle capable of driving in an urban environment.
    I developed lane detection, freespace detection and occupancy grid mapping <mark>ROS</mark> packages, and used several cameras and lidars by sensor fusion.
    I designed a single DNN network that is jointly trained on independent datasets, and accelerated it using <mark>TensorRT</mark> and <mark>CUDA</mark> on the NVIDIA Platform.
    During this period, I have grown my ability to implement various deep learning papers in various frameworks (<mark>Caffe</mark>, <mark>TensorFlow</mark>, <mark>Pytorch</mark>).

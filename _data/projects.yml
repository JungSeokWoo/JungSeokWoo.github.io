    (2020 @ LGE) Developed state-of-the-art lane detection for Autonomous driving & AR Navigation.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    We proposed fast and robust lane detection method based on an instance segmentation approach. Our algorithm achieved global rank 3 on the Tusimple Lane Detection Dataset ([link](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/lane-detection-on-tusimple)) and real-time performance on mobile platform.
    Our paper has been accepted in [ECCV 2020 Workshop on Perception for Autonomous Driving](https://sites.google.com/view/pad2020).
    We also implemented GPU/DSP/NPU runtime based DNN application by using <mark>Android</mark>, <mark>C++JNI</mark>, <mark>OpenCL</mark> and Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK(<mark>SNPE</mark>).
